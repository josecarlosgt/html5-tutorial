				<h2>About Me</h2>
				Hi, I am currently working as a lecturer in the Business School, <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a>.
				I am a nature lover who enjoys outdoors, especially hiking. During holidays,
				I like to go on <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/int/multi-day-hikes/" target="_blank">multi-day hikes</a>, where I have the opportunity to camp and spend several days in nature.
				While living in New Zealand, I have enjoyed places like,
				<ul>
					<li>Abel Tasman Park</li>
					<li>Tongariro National Park</li>
					<li>Kaimanawa Forest Park</li>
				</ul>
